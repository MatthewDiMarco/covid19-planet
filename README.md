# covid19-planet
Interactive 3d planetary visualization of global covid-19 data across 2020.

# Data
The data was provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins 
University. The most up-to-date files can be retrieved from their [repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Currently for the sake of the live demo, the "assets/data/" directory contains data up until 
03/24/2020. To run the application with the latest information, clone this repository and simply 
copy and paste the csv files inside "csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/" from the JHU 
repo into the data directory, replacing the old files.

# Acknowledgements
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) was used to generate and render the 3d elements.
